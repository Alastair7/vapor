# Vapor
Vapor is a multipurpose bot being developed for a specific discord server and Its objective is to bring features that helps users to navigate in an easier way across the server.
## Features
- **Music System:** It has a music system developed with discord-player package.
- **Reaction Role System:** Allows the creation of special messages where members can react and obtain roles.
- **Lobby System:** Members can create private/public lobbies to play with friends or with anyone.

More feature will be added in the future since the project is still in progress...

## Developed With
- **JavaScript**: I started with JS because I wanted to be better with the programming language but in the future I will change to TypeScript.
- **MongoDB(Mongoose)**: I didn't like the idea of using DB but It was a must when I started to develop the reaction role system.
- **NodeJS**: There's nothing to explain here... Without Node there's no bot ðŸ˜†

## Project Status:
Project is still in progress since I will be developing more features soon. My idea is to add Docker and Docker Compose and host the bot to keep it running 24/7.
